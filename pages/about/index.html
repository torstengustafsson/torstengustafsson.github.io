            <div class="col-xs-12" style="height:25px;"></div>
            <p>I have studied the Master of Science in Media Technology and Engineering (MT) program in Norrköping during 2012-2017. Currently I work for HiQ Ace in Norrköping as a consultant. I have worked at Ericsson R&D department since my first week at HiQ</p>
            <p>I am interested in real-time computer graphics, visualization, app development, system development and much more. I consider code quality to be an important part of any programming development process. In my spare time I like to work with computer graphics and new interesting ways to solve problems. Currently I am working on a fluid simulator in Rust.</p>
            <p>I publish most of my projects at <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/torstengustafsson">Github</a>. If you are interested you may also take a look at the projects section on this site for a quick summary of the projects I have worked with during the years.</p>
